# Julie's Corner - Personal Blog
This project is a simple blog site I build for my wife using Gatsby + Netlify
## Technologies
This website is build on **Gatsby boilerplate** with some useful **gastby-plugins**. Since the design of the page is pretty simple, the site is not based on any css library/framework, yet it is powered by **css preprocessor** (SASS).  
## Current status
The current version is live online, however, there are still a lot of room for further development.
