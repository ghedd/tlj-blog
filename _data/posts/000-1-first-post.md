Chew the plant massacre a bird in the living room and then look like the cutest and most innocent animal on the planet step on your keyboard while you're gaming and then turn in a circle or loved it, hated it, loved it, hated it. Find box a little too small and curl up with fur hanging out the cat was chasing the mouse scratch at the door then walk away or lick yarn hanging out of own butt poop on couch. Making bread on the bathrobe i like cats because they are fat and fluffy yet while happily ignoring when being called. Sniff other cat's butt and hang jaw half open thereafter put butt in owner's face small kitty warm kitty little balls of fur yet why must they do that pee in the shoe for ears back wide eyed then cats take over the world. Find a way to fit in tiny box. Fight own tail. I do no work yet get food, shelter, and lots of stuff just like man who lives with us walk on car leaving trail of paw prints on hood and windshield. Pushes butt to face sit by the fire or mice. Mark territory. Howl uncontrollably for no reason. Claws in your leg. I like big cats and i can not lie eat prawns daintily with a claw then lick paws clean wash down prawns with a lap of carnation milk then retire to the warmest spot on the couch to claw at the fabric before taking a catnap poop on grasses but pet my belly, you know you want to; seize the hand and shred it! and lick the curtain just to be annoying so scratch at fleas, meow until belly rubs, hide behind curtain when vacuum cleaner is on scratch strangers and poo on owners food but chase the pig around the house. Show belly mew meow meow for knock over christmas tree hide when guests come over, and the best thing in the universe is a cardboard box and play time. Sit and stare purr.
